    \n<b>What is DSP Manager?</b>
    \n\n
    DSP Manager is a per-output audio adjustment app. <i>DSP</i> stands for
    Digital signal processing, and the <i>Manager</i> part refers to the fact that the
    DSP is actually not run inside the app itself; the manager can only
    enable it for apps which are compliant with Android\'s audio effect
    specification, i.e. most music players.
    \n\nSee: https://github.com/james34602/JamesDSPManager
    \n\n
    <b>Philosophy</b>
    \n\n
    Audio processing supports four different output categories:
    wired headset, USB audio, phone speaker and bluetooth headset. There is a separate
    configuration panel for each output category. DSP Manager\'s philosophy is to
    correct each audio output\'s particular deficiencies in order to reach the most
    optimal listening experience with each.
    \n\n
    Unlike with AOSP audio effects, there are no per-app settings. This is
    a deliberate design choice: it is the output we care about, not which
    app generates the audio for DSP Manager to work with.
    \n\n\n
    <b>Features</b>
    \n\n
    1. <b>Dynamic range compression (DRC)</b>
    \n\n
    This effect estimates the loudness of the audio as perceived by an average
    listener and drives a gain control based on this estimate. The primary use case
    is with noisy environments such as in cars or on street, where quiet parts of
    music are in risk of being drowned out by background noise.
    \n\n
    The sole tunable determines how hard DSP Manager will try to maintain audio
    loudness at the target level. There is no AOSP equivalent for this DSP effect.
    \n\n\n
    2. <b>Bass boost</b>
    \n\n
    The bass boost is has two simple lowpass filters which can be used to add an emphasis
    at 55 Hz or selectable frequency and lower frequencies. The boost is around 6 dB, and modified by the
    \'strength\' parameter, which adds filters resonance at the 55 Hz or selectable frequency band, giving
    that frequency extra emphasis. The effect is designed to combat loss of bass
    frequency common with small speakers and supra-aural headsets which do not
    couple tightly with user\'s ear canal. Also enhance users bass experience.
    \n\n\n
    3. <b>Equalizer</b>
    \n\n
    This is a 6-band equalizer with bands at 15.625, 62,5, 250, 500, 1000, 4000, 8000 and 16000 Hz.
    Some common presets are provided, and the frequency response can also be
    customized by tapping on the equalizer graph. The effect should be used to tune
    the frequency response to user\'s personal taste, or to the particular
    capabilities of the available headset or speakers.
    \n\n
    Equalizer also contains a loudness compensation filter, which equalizes the
    changes in ear frequency response based on the sound pressure level which
    reaches the user\'s ear. Use of a wired headset is required, and the strength
    parameter value must be tuned correctly before the effect will work as
    designed.
    \n\n
    To select the right value for the compensation strength, use the quietest music
    volume, and choose some wide-spectrum noisy music such as rock or metal. Try
    to find a setting where the bass is boosted back into audibility and seems
    balanced with the rest of the material. After the compensation has been
    correctly configured, bass should remain at the same level relative to the
    other instruments regardless of the listening level. On the other hand, if
    music starts to sound bass heavy at higher listening levels, the compensation
    is probably set too strong, and should be reduced.
    \n\n
    The compensation is added to the user\'s chosen adjustments. If only compensation
    is desired, the equalizer should be left in the \'Flat\' setting.
    \n\n\n
    4. <b>Virtualizer</b>
    \n\n
    The headset filter is a crossfeed design inspired by the famous bs2b analog
    circuit. The effect passes mono sound unchanged, and adjusts the difference
    signal through a lowpass filter which approximates both head shadow and
    interaural delay at once, giving right kind of psychoacoustic clues for user\'s
    ears. The intention is to prevent listener fatigue arising from the
    implausible stereo separation inherent with all headsets. The effect should be
    enabled whenever using stereo headsets.
    \n\n
    Because the mixing reduces the stereo separation somewhat, there is a
    Haas effect reverb, which can be used to increase the perceived stereo image
    width. This is controlled by the \'Room type\' control.
    \n\n
    5. <b>Stereo Widener</b>
    \n\n
    Stereo Widener is a left-right channel direction splitter, it can enhance audio experience that when left-right speaker are put by a distance that is less than optimal
    \n\n<b>Audio enhancement can be done by using variety combination of different effectors!</b>
    We first calculate center and side channel data, and high pass side channel at 2000Hz, also add little bit delay effect on side channel, then add and subtract them respectively in order to synthesis left-right side position,
