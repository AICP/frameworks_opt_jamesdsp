# JamesDSPManager (Audio Effect Digital Signal Proccessing library for Android)
Merged with Omnirom DSP Manager features and able to run in all recent Android rom include Samsung, AOSP, Cyanogenmod. 
This app in order to improve your music experience especially you want realistic bass and more natural clarity.
We don't work too much around with modifying Android framework instead of we integrate framework with DSP Manager, let it less depend on system framework.

##### Basic:

1. Compression
2. Bass Boost
3. Virtualizer
4. 12 Band Hybrid Equalizer (1 low shelf, 10 bands shelves, 1 high shelves)(Different bands designed with different filter order)
5. Stereo Widen
6. Adjustable Low pass filter(Bass Boost)
7. 3 custom bass boost mode

##### On development:
1. Parameterized Room Convolution

	-->May be I will implement this in my other repository: [Complete C implementation of Room Impulse Response Generator](https://github.com/james34602/RIR-Generator)

2.Linear phase bass boost

##### Development completed but haven't published yet:
1. Overlap-based convolution

	-->Will be use libHybridConv as library, just like EqualizerAPO. Since my implementation on overlap-add convolution does not do any faster then others library, so I will use best performance library:)

Now work on AOSP, Cyanogenmod, Samsung on Android 5.0 ,6.0 and 7.0(TESTED)
