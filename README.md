# JamesDSPManager (Audio Effect Digital Signal Processing library for Android)
GUI is based on Omnirom DSP Manager and able to run in all recent Android rom include Samsung, AOSP, Cyanogenmod. 
This app in order to improve your music experience especially you want realistic bass and more natural clarity.
This app don't work too much around with modifying Android framework.

##### Features:

1. Compression
2. Bass Boost

   --> 2048/4096 order FIR linear phase bass boost
3. Reverberation

   --> GVerb and Progenitor 2
4. FIR Equalizer (Cubic spline interpolated 15 bands equalizer)[How smooth it is?](https://rawgit.com/james34602/JamesDSPManager/master/SmoothEq.svg)
5. Stereo Widen
6. BS2B
7. Partitioned Convolver (Auto segmenting selection)

   --> Support mono, stereo, full/true stereo(LL, LR, RL, RR) IR
   
   --> Samples per channels for stereo impulse response should less than 1000000
   
   --> Samples per channels for full stereo impulse response should less than 500000

8. Vacuum tube modelling

### FAQ
#### 1. Computation datatype?

A: Float32

#### 2. Bass boost filter type?

A: Effect has 2 options to boost low frequency band, IIR based is obsoleted, equalizer already do the job.

   Filtering is work on convolution basis. When user change the bass boost parameter, engine will compute new low pass filter(with gain) impulse response using firls(Function ported from Matlab).
   
   2048/4096 order FIR filter should work on all frequency listed on options.

#### 3. What is convolver?

A: Convolver is a effect apply convolution(a mathematical operation) on audio signal, that perfectly apply user desired impulse response on music, it could simulate physical space.

   Effect itself require audio file(.wav/.irs/.flac) to become impulse response source.

   For more info: [Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) and [Convolution reverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_reverb)

#### 3. What is Analog Modelling?

A: Analog Modelling internal work as a vacuum tube amplifier, was designed by [ZamAudio](https://github.com/zamaudio).
The tube they used to model is 12AX7 double triode. They also provide a final stage of tonestack control, it make sound more rich. However, the major parameters is amplifier preamp, this is how even ordered harmonic come from, but this parameter have been limited at maximum 12.0. Input audio amplitude is decided by user, thus louder volume will generate more harmonics and internal amplifier will tend to clip the audio. Analog amplifier was built from real mathematical model, most notably is nonlinearity of vacuum tube.
Original is written in C++, for some reasons I ported it to C implementation.

#### 5. What is Misc folder does?

File reverbHeap is modified Progenitor 2 reverb, memory allocation is using heap not stack, it will be useful when you play around with Visual Studio, because VS have 1Mb stack allocation limit...

#### 6. Why libjamesdsp.so so big?

A: Because of fftw3 library linked.

#### 7. Why open source? Any license?

A: Audio effects actually is not hard to implement, I don't think close source is a good idea. Many audio effects is exist in the form of libraries, or even in thesis, everyone can implement it...
   All files in this repository is published under GPLv2.

#### 8. Can I use your audio effect code?

A: Yes. It is relatively easy to use some effect in other applications. Convolver, reverb, 12AX7 tube amplifier source code is written in similar style, you can look at the how their function is called, initialised, processed, etc. Most of the effect is written in C, so it is easy to port to other platforms without huge modifications.

#### 9. Why no effect after installed?

A: Check step in release build ReadMe.txt.
   Effect may get unloaded by Android system if no audio stream for while.
   Another common situation: audio_effects.conf is file for system to load effect using known UUID, you can try to add
   ```
  jdsp {
    path /system/lib/soundfx/libjamesdsp.so
  }
   ```
   ### under
   ```
   bundle {
    path /system/lib/soundfx/libbundlewrapper.so
  }
   ```
   ### AND
   ```
   jamesdsp {
    library jdsp
    uuid f27317f4-c984-4de6-9a90-545759495bf2
  }
   ```
   ### under
   ```
   effects {
   ```

##### On development / Coming up:
1. Algorithmic spatialization (Simulated 7.1 surround) impulse response, a quad channels impulse response that generated by my proprietary HRTF algorithm.
It would be downloadable on public domain.

##### TODO:
1. Eliminate remain C++ part from major signal processing code, which is used only in Equalizer. May replace by minimum phase or linear phase equalizer, also used in current FIR bass boost.
2. Doesn't detect Bluetooth headset when device boot up.

Now work on AOSP, Cyanogenmod, Samsung on Android 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0/7.1(TESTED)

# Important
This won't require to modify SELinux(in most case), let your device become more safe.
Also, it's good to customizing your own rom or even port rom with JamesDSP.
